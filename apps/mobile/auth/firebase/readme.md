In order to use Native Google Signin in react native, we need the Firebase files as per these docs: [https://react-native-google-signin.github.io/docs/setting-up/get-config-file#with-firebase](https://react-native-google-signin.github.io/docs/setting-up/get-config-file#with-firebase)

Please copy the `google-services.json` and `GoogleService.Info.plist` files in this directory
