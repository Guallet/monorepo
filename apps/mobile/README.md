## Guallet Mobile app

## How to build and run the app

From the `apps/mobile` directory, run

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

to install the dependencies and run the Metro server. You will need to configure some prerequisites to run the app as expected:

### Create .env file

Create a `.env` file in the mobile root folder

```bash
cd apps/mobile
touch .env
```

Use the `.env.sample` file to see the required variables the app requires.

### Configure Supabase

The app uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for user authentication. You can host Supabase in your own server, but also can use the free tier to create an account and setup `Email` and `Google` as login providers.

Remember to configure the `Url Configuration` redirection in Supabase correctly according to your domain/server for the Guallet WebApp. For the mobile App, this is not required as it uses native Google Signin.

### Configure Firebase files

The app uses [React Native Google Sign In](https://react-native-google-signin.github.io/) to use native Login Signin functionality. Please read their documentation to configure the login using Firebase.

Once this is ready, you will have two Firebase config files:

- google-services.json (for Android)
- GoogleService-Info.plist (for iOS)

Download the files and place them in the following directory

> app/mobile/auth/firebase

## Github Actions and CI/EAS

There are some Github Actions files inside the `.github/workflows` folder that help with some internal EAS preview/deployment. You can have a look at them and adjust them to replicate them to work with your own EAS account.
